## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Simplified Attendance Tracking:** No need to mark every single class. Simply provide the total number of classes conducted and attended so far, and the app handles all calculations.
* **Advanced Predictive Analysis:** The app's key feature is a powerful calculator that lets you see how your attendance will be affected by future absences. You can select any future date and enter the number of *whole days* or *individual classes* you plan to skip to get a precise, real-time prediction.
* **Intelligent & Flexible Holiday Calendar:** The app is designed for the Indian academic calendar. It automatically considers the following as holidays:
    * All Sundays.
    * A built-in list of major Indian public holidays (e.g., Republic Day, Diwali, Independence Day).
    * **Customizable Saturdays:** You can select which Saturdays of the month (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th) are holidays at your specific institution.
    * The ability to add your own custom holidays for any other event.
* **"Week at a Glance" Dashboard:** The main dashboard provides a visual overview of your class schedule for the next 7 days, so you always know what's coming up.
* **Secure Cloud Storage:** All your data is securely saved to your personal account using Firebase Firestore. Log in from any device and your data is always there.
* **Easy Timetable Management:** You can add your class schedule manually or, for a more mobile-friendly experience, simply paste your timetable text (in JSON format) directly into a text box.
* **Google Authentication:** Secure and easy login using your existing Google account via OAuth 2.0.
