Attendify: A Smart Attendance Tracker & Predictor

Attendify is a modern, user-friendly web application designed to help students, particularly in India, effortlessly track, manage, and predict their class attendance. Gone are the days of manual calculations and uncertainty. With Attendify, you can easily stay on top of your attendance requirements and make informed decisions about skipping classes.

The application is built with a clean, responsive interface featuring both light and dark modes, and securely stores all your data online using Google's Firebase, accessible via a simple Google login.
‚ú® Core Features

    Simplified Attendance Tracking: No need to mark every single class. Simply provide the total number of classes conducted and attended so far, and the app handles all calculations.

    Predictive Analysis: The app's key feature allows you to see how your overall attendance percentage will be affected if you decide to miss classes in the future. This helps you make informed decisions to stay above your institution's minimum attendance requirements.

        All Sundays

        The 2nd and 4th Saturday of every month

        A built-in list of major Indian public holidays (e.g., Republic Day, Diwali, Independence Day).

        The ability to add your own custom holidays (e.g., for college festivals or specific events).

    Secure Cloud Storage: All your data, from your timetable to your attendance record, is securely saved to your personal account using Firebase Firestore. Log in from any device and your data is always there.

    Easy Timetable Management: You can add your class schedule manually or upload a simple JSON file to populate it instantly.
