# Attxenz: User Manual

Welcome to Attxenz! This guide will walk you through setting up and using the app to master your attendance.

---
## 1. Getting Started: First-Time Setup

The first time you log in, your dashboard will be empty. To bring the app to life, you must first configure your details on the **Settings** page.

Click on the **Settings** icon in the sidebar to begin.

---
## 2. The Settings Page: Your Control Center

This is the most important page for setting up the app. You must fill out these sections for the calculations to be accurate.

### **A. Semester Information**
* **Semester Start Date:** Select the first day of your semester. This is crucial for calculating total classes and holidays.
* **Semester End Date:** Select the last day of your semester.

### **B. Attendance (To Date)**
This section is for tracking your attendance if your semester has already begun.
* **Total Classes Conducted So Far:** Enter the total number of classes that have happened in all subjects combined up to today.
* **Total Classes You Attended So Far:** Enter the total number of classes you have actually attended.

### **C. Class Timetable**
You have two ways to add your weekly schedule:

**Method 1: Paste Timetable Text (Recommended for Mobile)**
This is the easiest way to add your schedule.
1.  Copy your timetable in the correct text format (JSON).
2.  Paste the text directly into the large text box.
3.  Click the **"Import from Text"** button. Your classes will appear below.

**Method 2: Add Classes Manually**
1.  Enter the **Class Name**, **Time**, and select the **Day** from the dropdown.
2.  Click the **"Add Class"** button.
3.  Repeat for every class in your weekly schedule.

### **D. Holidays**
Attxenz has a smart holiday system.
* **Automatic Holidays:** All **Sundays** and major **Indian Public Holidays** are automatically considered holidays. You don't need to add them.
* **Saturday Holidays:** Your college might have a unique Saturday schedule. Use the checkboxes to select which Saturdays of the month are holidays for you (e.g., 2nd and 4th).
* **Custom Holidays:** Use the date picker to add any other specific holidays your institution might have (e.g., for college festivals or events) and click **"Add Holiday"**.

### **E. Save Everything!**
After you've filled out all the sections, click the green **"Save All Settings"** button at the bottom to save your configuration.

## 3. The Dashboard: Your Daily View

Once you've saved your settings, the Dashboard becomes your main hub.

### **Stat Cards**
At the top, you'll see three main statistics:
* **Current Attendance:** Your overall attendance percentage based on the numbers you entered in the settings.
* **Total Semester Classes:** An *estimate* of the total number of classes for your entire semester, calculated from your timetable and semester dates.
* **Attended Classes (So Far):** The total number of classes you have attended to date.

### **Advanced Attendance Prediction**
This is the most powerful tool in the app. It lets you plan ahead.
1.  **Calculate on date:** Select any future date. The calculator will tell you your attendance percentage *on that day*.
2.  **Working days I'll skip:** Enter the number of *full working days* you plan to miss between now and your selected date. The app will calculate how many classes this equals based on your timetable.
3.  **Extra classes I'll skip:** If you plan to miss a few individual classes (but not a whole day), enter that number here.
4.  **Predicted Attendance:** The orange number shows your final, predicted attendance percentage, combining all the factors.

### **Week at a Glance**
This section gives you a quick visual overview of your class schedule for the next seven days, helping you see what's coming up.
