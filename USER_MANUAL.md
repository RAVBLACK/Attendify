## 2. The Dashboard: Your Daily View

The Dashboard is your main hub for a high-level overview of your **cumulative attendance**.

### **Stat Cards**
At the top, you'll see key statistics based on the data you enter in the **"Cumulative Log"**.
* **Current Attendance:** Your overall attendance percentage.
* **Attendance Goal:** A progress bar showing how close you are to your goal. When you are below your goal, it will show you how many more classes you need to attend to reach it. Once reached, it will display a success message.
* **Total Semester Classes:** An *estimate* of the total number of classes for your entire semester.

### **Advanced Attendance Prediction**
This tool lets you plan ahead for your cumulative attendance. Select a future date and enter the number of days or classes you plan to skip to see the impact on your overall percentage.

### **Today's Classes**
This card gives you a quick visual overview of your class schedule for the current day.
